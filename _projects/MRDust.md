<p style="text-align: justify;">
MRI is a powerful diagnostic tool that provides detailed anatomical structure and physiological information. However, functional MRI techniques are indirect and low resolution. We design wireless implantable sensors that measure high-resolution physiological information, and augment MR images with the measured data by actively modulating the image voxels with an on-chip micro-coil. The implant performs 1) ultrasonic energy harvesting and downlink data communication 2) physiological signal sensing and storage 3) data uplink by modulating MR images.

## Key Contributions

- **Wireless Implantable Sensors**: Developed tiny wireless sensors that can be implanted to measure high-resolution physiological data within the MRI environment
- **Active Image Modulation**: Created on-chip micro-coils that actively modulate MR image voxels to encode physiological measurements directly into the scan data
- **Physiological Signal Integration**: Designed sensors that perform real-time physiological signal sensing, storage, and uplink data transmission through MR image modulation
