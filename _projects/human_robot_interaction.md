We aim to improve the cooperation between humans and robots by equipping robots with the capability of using multiple modes of information sources to understand, align with, and adapt human goals and preferences.

For this purpose, we computationally model human behavior using techniques from machine learning, behavioral economics, cognitive science, and game theory.

## Research Areas

- **Partner-Aware Algorithms**: AI systems that make better decisions in human-robot collaboration tasks by predicting humans' actions
- **Personalization**: Adapting robot behaviors to individual human preferences and needs
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Integrating speech, gestures, gaze, and other forms of human communication
- **Trust and Transparency**: Building systems that humans can understand and trust

## Applications

Our work has been applied to:
- Home robotics systems
- Lower-body exoskeletons for people with paralysis
- Collaborative manufacturing
- Educational robots
