# USC Lira Lab
USC Lira Lab's website, hosted on GitHub Pages!

This fork integrates a REX-lab style Research Projects section using a Jekyll collection.

Editing research projects
1. Add or edit files in `_projects/`. Example: `_projects/example_project.md`.
2. Front matter fields:
   - `title`: Project title
   - `description`: Short markdown description
   - `people`: List of names, matching `name` in `_data/people.yml`
   - `image`: Path to a banner image
   - `last-updated`: YYYY-MM-DD
   - `layout`: `project` (required)
3. Project pages automatically render a People section.

Editing people
- Update `_data/people.yml`. Ensure `name` matches entries referenced in project front matter.

Research listing page
- `research.html` shows a grid of projects with people thumbnails, sorted by `last-updated`.

Development
- Standard Jekyll workflow. If using the original Rakefile flow, publish from the `source` branch; otherwise build locally with Jekyll.

## Developing the Website
To develop, **you must do your work on the `source` branch**. `main` is autogenerated via a `rake` job (you can see the details in `Rakefile`). The `source` branch contains all the Jekyll code. To do this, simply execute
```
git checkout source
```

## Publishing the Website
When you've made the desired changes and are in the `source` branch, simply execute:
```
rake publish
```
If you want commit with a custom commit message, do:
```
rake publish["custom commit message\, and this is how to use a comma"]
```

This will rebuild the site, commit your changes to the `source` branch, and deploy the generated site to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages will pick up on this change and update `usc-lira.github.io` with the new changes.

**NOTE**: This GitHub Pages link is the where the `liralab.usc.edu` proxies point to, so this repository and the corresponding GitHub Page is the "actual" website.
